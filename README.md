## Disclaimers

By using this modpack, you agree to the following:

* The command *`/ghost`* (provided by [AntiGhost](https://modrinth.com/mod/antighost)) may be disallowed by the rules on some servers [as it sends a slight amount of packets](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/antighost?comment=103), but it is safe if you don't spam it, use only  when you are stuck in blocks.
* This modpack is using [Starlight](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/starlight) for chunk optimization and [due to the way it works](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/blob/fabric/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md#chunk-save-format), disabling (or replacing) the mod will make your existing worlds initially load a bit slower. This is harmless, it simply means the game is calculating the lit up areas again with a different algorithm.
*  [The "social interactions" screen](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Social_Interactions_screen#Usage) can be used by pressing the key `P` in-game or the `Player Reporting` button in the pause menu.
* Yes, you can fork/remix this pack [according to the license](https://github.com/dorrelredmond/redsky-origins/blob/main/LICENSE). You cannot, however, use the "Redsky Origins" name or logo to _represent_ your fork (but you can mention that you forked it).
